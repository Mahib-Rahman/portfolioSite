                    <p>
                        I had an old DELL Inspiron All-in-One computer
                        that wasn't being used. I did some research and 
                        figured that I could use the LCD screen to make 
                        a monitor/display.  
                        
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Procsee</h2>
                    <p>
                        I took apart the All-in-one and isolated the LCD screen.
                        I then got an LCD controller and power supply that were 
                        compatible with the screen. I then assembled the display 
                        and kept the outer chassy of the All in one to make the 
                        monitor look more pleasing. (Bonus: there was a 4gb ram 
                        stick in the all-in-one which I pluged into my Mac Mini
                        to increase it's ram)

                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p>
                        I did some Research into Monitor prices and saw 
                        that even used monitors this size were going $80+. 
                        This project cost a total of $37.95. This was the 
                        better economical decision and I also learned a lot.
